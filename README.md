## Welcome to Red-Nose Rebels, your rebellious Christmas challenge!

# Placeholder: Mock-up from Am-I-Responsive

Red-Nose Rebels is a classic board game in which Father Christmas’s reindeer have grown tired of Rudolph’s prominent role during the annual festive season. Players choose one of Father Christmas’s reindeer — Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, or Blitzen — to challenge Rudolph in a race to the finish line.

The winning reindeer not only earns the coveted pole position in the annual race to deliver presents on time, but also gets to wear Rudolph’s famous red nose (hence the name Red-Nose Rebels). While the game follows a straightforward and accessible set of rules, it encourages strategic thinking and creativity within a festive setting.

So, join us on the track and compete to claim the most famous red nose in history. After all, rolling the dice has never been more fun!
